This project examines U.S. homelessness data from 2018, focusing on:  

- Unaccompanied homeless youth under 18  
- Overall homelessness by state  
- Regions with strong shelter coverage (low unsheltered rates)  

🔍 **Featured Insight:** Some regions with large homeless populations maintain unsheltered rates below 2%, highlighting the impact of coordinated shelter services.

## Key Questions
- Which CoCs report the highest counts of unaccompanied homeless youth?  
- Which states have the largest overall homeless populations?  
- Which locations maintain very low unsheltered homelessness rates, and what does this suggest about shelter systems?

## Datasets & Insights

| File | Description | Key Insight |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `unaccompanied_youth_top3_2018.csv` | Top 3 CoCs by unaccompanied youth under 18 | San Jose/Santa Clara CoC has the highest number of youth, followed by Oregon Balance of State and Las Vegas/Clark County. Youth homelessness is concentrated in a few urban areas. |
| `top7_states_homeless_2018.csv` | Top 7 states by total homeless population | California (~129,972) and New York (~91,897) have the largest homeless populations, representing a majority of national homelessness. |
| `low_unsheltered_locations_2018.csv` | Locations with unsheltered populations under 2% | Some regions maintain very low unsheltered rates despite large populations, indicating effective shelter strategies. |

## Visualizations

### 1. Top 3 CoCs – Under 18
![Top 3 CoCs – Under 18](https://github.com/cianaellington-data/homelessness-analysis/raw/main/top3_cocs_under18_2018.png)  
*Insight: Youth homelessness is concentrated in a few CoCs, suggesting that targeted interventions could have a high impact.*

### 2. Low Unsheltered Locations
![Low Unsheltered Locations](https://github.com/cianaellington-data/homelessness-analysis/raw/main/low_unsheltered_locations_2018.png)  
*Insight: Locations with <2% unsheltered populations demonstrate successful shelter strategies that could serve as models for other regions.*

### 3. Top 7 States – Total Homeless
![Top 7 States – Total Homeless](https://github.com/cianaellington-data/homelessness-analysis/raw/main/top7_states_total_homeless_2018.png)  
*Insight: California and New York dominate the national homeless population, showing where state-level resources are most needed.*
